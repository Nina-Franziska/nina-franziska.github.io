    <h2  class = "cormorant-garamond-light one-liner">I have been developing the virtual reality tool Virtual Scenario Responder for the research team at the Institute of Architecture and Design.
        A demo of the tool as well as our latest research experiment was exhibited as part of the exhibition Adfærd / Velfærd from autumn 2022 to spring 2023, and showcased at the UIA Architecture World Congress in summer 2023.</h2>
     
    <p>We developed three types of digital twins: <br>
        * One with realistic lighting and materials<br>
        * One with optimised real-time lighting and materials<br>
        * A laser scan (which turned out very abstract because of various artefacts from e.g. reflections)<br><br>

        <p class = "projectDescription"> Virtual Scenario Responder is a tool to visualize architectural spaces in VR, and track people’s gaze and movement within these spaces. In February 2022 we did an experiment, the auditoriums of the Royal Danish Academy were built 1:1 in virtual space. People’s brain response was then measured while moving through the physical space versus the virtual space.
            The results were quite groundbreaking, showing how the mental processing of participants while moving around in the most realistic virtual representation of the auditoriums (which was the most comfortable one) in VR was much higher than in the other scenarios, including the physical space.
