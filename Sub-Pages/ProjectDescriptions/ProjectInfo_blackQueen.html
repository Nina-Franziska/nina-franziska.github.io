    The Black Queen is an interactive virtual actor made for live theatre. The
    virtual actor reacts to various modes of interaction such as hand gestures
    and motion tracking. The movement of the virtual actor is based on the
    flocking algorithm, and responds to both actions made by the actress and
    predefined ques.

      <!-- The installation operated in real-time, utilizing direct audio input from
      the band's music to create a dynamic and responsive environment. This
      setup was adaptable to concert settings, where it could use live music
      from the band to further enhance the real-time aspect of the experience.
      The SØSTR Immersive Installation highlighted the potential of immersive
      installations to transform traditional music venues into cutting-edge
      spaces for artistic exploration and audience interaction. By blurring the
      lines between live performance and interactive art, the collaboration set
      a new standard in Denmark for how we can experience music. -->
